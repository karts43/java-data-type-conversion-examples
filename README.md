java-data-type-conversion-examples
This repository contains Java example files demonstrating primitive data types and type conversion rules. Each file focuses on one data type, covering valid and invalid assignments, range limits, and compile-time errors.

Included Examples
ByteTypeExamples.java
Shows byte min & max values (-128 to 127)

Explains byte arithmetic and type promotion to int

Demonstrates use of final bytes in expressions

Shows ASCII character values stored in bytes

Includes invalid assignments causing compile errors

Great for beginners to understand byte behavior and conversions

FloatTypeExamples.java 🚀
This Java file demonstrates the use of the float data type in Java along with type conversions involving:

int to float

long to float

char to long to float

Invalid conversions like boolean or String to float

Unicode and literal suffix usage: f, l, d

Covered Topics:

Float min & max range

Literal suffix usage (f, l, d)

Widening conversions (e.g., char to float)

Compile-time errors with incompatible types

Invalid Examples:

Assigning true to float

Assigning "Hello" to float

Using large double literals without casting

Learning Outcome:
By running this file, you’ll understand how Java handles primitive type conversions and where type mismatches cause errors.

Future Plans
More files for the remaining primitive types will be added:

short

int

long

double

char

boolean
